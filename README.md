# Aws Amplify Boilerplate 

This app includes a basic boilerplate setup to achieve CI/CD with AWS Amplify and implement AWS authentication as well as a GraphQL API. This is intended to be an example of hosting an application on AWS where most of the services a user would need are integrated directly from AWS itself, minimizing the need for bringing in multiple third party services and thus minimizing potential conflicts between services.
